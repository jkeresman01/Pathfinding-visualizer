# Pathfinding-visualizer #
..... Not baked yet.

Hi I wrote visualization tool for path finding algorithms(BFS, DFS, Dijkstra).

## Maze solving ##
A maze is a type of puzzle involving a collection of paths, usually where a player has to find a route from start to finish.
There is a huge variety of algorithms based on graph theory for generating mazes (Randomized DFS, Iterative randomized Kruskal's algorithm, Iterative randomized Prim's algorithm...)
For this purpose I'am using variation of Randomized DFS (Recursive Backtracking).
